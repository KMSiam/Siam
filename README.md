```

### Altering Color Themes
The website's primary styling features custom CSS variables. To change the accent color, gradient, or background colors, open `assets/css/styles.css` and modify the values defined within the `:root` and `[data-theme="light"]` blocks:

:root {
  --accent-primary: #6c63ff; /* Edit your main brand color here */
